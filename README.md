For this project I redesigned the Nike clothing website. 
This was completed in fall of 2021 for the class 204 (Web Developement) using HTML, CSS, and BootStrap.
program description:
At the top there is a bar with the nike logo, different dropdown menus to select from (mens, womens, footwear, etc.) and a search bar that you can input words into that will dissapear when you hit enter.
The main page is made up of different featured items for each category in a scrollable bootstrap box.
