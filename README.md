For this project I redesigned the Nike clothing website. 
This was completed in fall of 2021 for the class 204 (Web Developement) using HTML, CSS, and BootStrap.
program description:
At the top there is a bar with the nike logo, different dropdown menus to select from (mens, womens, footwear, etc.) and a search bar that you can input words into that will dissapear when you hit enter.
The main page is made up of different featured items with each category in a scrollable bootstrap box. The boxes are offset from one another and have a fake link to what would be a different web page ideally featuring those items plus more.
At the bottom there is a nike logo photo for design and clickable links to things such as "find a store", "become a member", etc. and there are logos that would lead to twitter, face book youtube and instagram, as well as sign in and login buttoms that would link to sign in and login pages.
This website is purely a design and isn't functional because I did not know how to use java script at the time of making it, however it has many other cool features thanks to bootstrap including that if you adjust the size of the screen it can adjust to the size of a phone!
